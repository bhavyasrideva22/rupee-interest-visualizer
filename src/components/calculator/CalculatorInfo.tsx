            Simple interest is a fundamental concept in finance that calculates interest on the initial principal only.

          <p className="text-charcoal mb-4">
            Simple interest is a quick method to calculate the interest charge on a loan or financial product. 
            It's calculated only on the initial principal amount, unlike compound interest which is calculated on 
            both the principal and accumulated interest. This makes it easier to predict and calculate over time.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-dark-green mt-8 mb-3">Comparing Simple Interest vs. Compound Interest</h3>
          <p className="text-charcoal mb-4">
            While simple interest calculates interest only on the initial principal, compound interest calculates interest on 
            both the principal and the accumulated interest. Over long periods, this difference can be substantial.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal mb-4">
            For investors, compound interest generally yields higher returns for long-term investments. However, for borrowers, 
            loans with simple interest structures are often more beneficial as they result in lower total interest payments.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-dark-green mt-8 mb-3">Tips for Maximizing Benefits of Simple Interest Products</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 my-3">
            <li>Compare interest rates across different financial institutions before investing or taking a loan.</li>
            <li>For borrowers, try to make prepayments whenever possible to reduce the outstanding principal.</li>
            <li>For short-term investments (1-3 years), simple interest products often provide competitive returns with lower risk.</li>
            <li>Consider tax implications of interest income, as interest earned is taxable according to your income tax slab in India.</li>
            <li>Align investment tenures with your financial goals to maximize returns while maintaining necessary liquidity.</li>
